<div class="d">
    <p>Gesture-controlled interfaces are becoming popular with the recent advent of IoT systems.
        Especially in the current automobiles, smart homes, computer games and AR/VR applications,
        gestures have become prevalent due to its accessibility to everyone. Designers, producers and
        vendors integrating gesture interfaces into their products have also increased in numbers, giving
        rise to a greater variation of standards in utilizing them. This could confuse the users who are
        accustomed to a set of conventional controls. This ontology formally describes human gestures and
        facilitate automated reasoning tasks which help systems to map gestures to corresponding affordances.
        This will be helpful for standardizing gesture designing and to bring interoperability across
        gesture-controlled interfaces.</p>
